## Hi, I'm Josh!

# I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating interactive experiences.

I taught myself programming through resources like FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy, and have been able to apply those skills to my career in hospitality. In my free time, I enjoy building games in Unity and websites with React.

My most recent project, "wowdle", was inspired by my current obsession with the new Dragonflight expansion of World of Warcraft. If you're a WoW player too, give it a try!
